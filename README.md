<p>In this course, trainer and developer Maaike van Putten provides the missing link to help JavaScript developers get started with TypeScript. If your skills are already beyond a regular TypeScript introduction course and not yet enough for courses solely focused on using TypeScript with Node, Angular, and so on, this course bridges the gaps and gets you ready to advance. </p>

<p>Dive into TypeScript, beginning with an introduction to TypeScript, its setup, and basic compilation. Progress through fundamental concepts, advanced typing, and practical application. Plus, explore real-world project migrations and integrations with popular frameworks. </p>

<p>After completing the course, you will be proficient in TypeScript, able to transition from JavaScript to TypeScript and improve existing projects or start new ones with a solid foundation in TypeScript's advanced type system. You will also be prepared to tackle real-world development challenges. </p>

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
